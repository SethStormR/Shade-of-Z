# Shade of Z

Shade of Z is an icon set for Zorin OS  (16). It aims to streamline the icons in the Zorin envoriment, so application icons are in match with the panel icons (menu launcher, systray etc.). Shade of Z is based on Papirus icon theme.

I'll take requests for which app icons I should put in next. If I get no requests I take (almost) randomly from the long list of apps and put it in as I go. So don't hesitate with the list of apps you think I should put in. You can make a request here under "issues" or go to Zorin OS forum and post it in this thread: https://forum.zorin.com/t/shade-of-z-icon-themes-for-zorin-os/4349

NOTE: If you use snap of a specific app the icon won't change. This is due to that icons are hard coded into the snap package and you have to manually set the icon with "menu editor".

Shade of Z comes with a variety of custom folders (v.0.3+) and colors (v.0.2+) that fit the default GTK colors of Zorin OS.
